    "description": "This utility tool creates a text-based abundance/count file by combining the three files typically distributed by 10x Genomics for both single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. Most often, these files will be named matrix.mtx.gz, barcodes.tsv.gz, and features.tsv.gz. These sparse-matrix formats are convenient for distribution of the files, but many analysis tools require a single, text-based file.",
